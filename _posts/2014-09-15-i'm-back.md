After five months of not keeping my promise (writing a post everyday) I am back with a new and updated blog. This time, I have more time on my hands, and I have a plan. Instead of starting off with the goal of writing a post daily, I will start out slowly, maybe three posts a week and increase from there.

I may not have been writing about things I learned, but I WAS cataloging topics to write about, and I have created quite an extensive list that you can look forward to. So, once more, hopefully this time in a more consistent fashion, I will learn new things and write about them. This time, I will keep my promise.
