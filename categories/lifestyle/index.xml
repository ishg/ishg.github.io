      <description>I ran my first 10K race today at the 2015 Panerathon in Youngstown, OH. The following describes how it went.
Pro-tip: Don&amp;rsquo;t eat a full pizza AND Chipotle the night before running a race.
 Mile 0: Blast off to the bass drop of Calvin Harris&amp;rsquo;s Sweet Nothing Remix Mile 0 - 1: Pew, pew, pew, I keep passing people. Such slowpokes. This is fun. Clock fastest mile time at 7:34.</description>

      <description>This year has been good to me. I have visited three countries and stepped on another continent. I have met a lot of new people and made some great new friends. Many new experiences have enriched my life and given me a better perspective of the world, of people, and of myself.
Why did I write this? Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve read the first paragraph, clearly, I know everything about the world.</description>

      <title>Sikhism - The Tenets</title>

      <description>Sikhism is the 5th largest religion in the world and has been around since the 15th century. The Holy Book of Sikhism, known as Sri Guru Granth Sahib, is composed of 1,430 pages and contains the teachings of the ten Gurus on how to live a just and virtuous life. That is a lot of pages to read and understand. However, the essence of the message of Sikhism can truly be found in just the first nine phrases of the book.</description>

      <description>In order to cross off another thing off my Impossible List, I went skydiving today. Iâ€™m not too big on large men strapped to my back with our pelvic regions in close proximity, so I chose to go the Accelerated Free Fall (AFF) route. Start Skydiving in Middletown, OH, the number 1 dropzone in the world, offers the First Jump Course for people who want to learn the basics of skydiving and may want to pursue a license in the future.</description>
