      <description>This weekend, Byers Imports unveiled the new Jaguar F-Type Coupe and invited people to autocross for free. I set up a Raspberry Pi at the start line to record a picture every 10 seconds. It managed to capture every car that autocrossed and a pretty cool view of the moving clouds.
  Connect the camera The folks over at Raspberry Pi have created a nice tutorial of how to setup the camera and connect it to Pi.</description>
