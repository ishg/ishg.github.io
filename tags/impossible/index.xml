      <description>I ran my first 10K race today at the 2015 Panerathon in Youngstown, OH. The following describes how it went.
Pro-tip: Don&amp;rsquo;t eat a full pizza AND Chipotle the night before running a race.
 Mile 0: Blast off to the bass drop of Calvin Harris&amp;rsquo;s Sweet Nothing Remix Mile 0 - 1: Pew, pew, pew, I keep passing people. Such slowpokes. This is fun. Clock fastest mile time at 7:34.</description>

      <description>In order to cross off another thing off my Impossible List, I went skydiving today. Iâ€™m not too big on large men strapped to my back with our pelvic regions in close proximity, so I chose to go the Accelerated Free Fall (AFF) route. Start Skydiving in Middletown, OH, the number 1 dropzone in the world, offers the First Jump Course for people who want to learn the basics of skydiving and may want to pursue a license in the future.</description>
