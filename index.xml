        <title>My First 10K</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I ran my first 10K race today at the 2015 Panerathon in Youngstown, OH. The following describes how it went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pro-tip&lt;/em&gt;: Don&amp;rsquo;t eat a full pizza AND Chipotle the night before running a race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mile 0:&lt;/strong&gt; Blast off to the bass drop of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://youtu.be/17ozSeGw-fY?t=108&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Calvin Harris&amp;rsquo;s Sweet Nothing Remix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mile 0 - 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Pew, pew, pew, I keep passing people. Such slowpokes. This is fun. Clock fastest mile time at 7:34.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mile 1 - 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh noes, we got some hills. Listen to Matt and just put one step in front of another instead of trying to race up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mile 2:&lt;/strong&gt; My average mile time is down to 8:32. The winner of the race passes me going the other way. He is on Mile 4. He is fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mile 2 - 3:&lt;/strong&gt; There&amp;rsquo;s a stitch in my side. I should stop. I slow down. The next song my phone plays is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzExWz7KP5M&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;I Can&amp;rsquo;t Stop by Flux Pavilion&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;rsquo;t stop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mile 3.1:&lt;/strong&gt; Halfway point. If this was a 5K race, it would be my slowest one so far. All those slowpokes are passing me now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mile 3 - 4:&lt;/strong&gt; I force myself to smile, which releases endorphins and keeps me going.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mile 4:&lt;/strong&gt; DJ Snake boosts me into a mini sprint for three seconds. My body&amp;rsquo;s not having it. Throw up in my mouth a little. Hold the gates! Oh no, here comes the second wave. Stop and expel breakfast by the side of the road. This is a hard reset. Feeling good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mile 4 - 5:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve found a good pace. Follow the magic of yoga pants and a tutu for a bit. Aw, she had to stop. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll just follow this guy for a while. Nope, there he goes. Maybe I can keep up with this old fella. Nope, there he goes. Who&amp;rsquo;s the slowpoke now?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mile 5 - 5.5:&lt;/strong&gt; The Return of the Stitch. Take Matt&amp;rsquo;s advice and run the rest of the race with my thumb jammed into my abdomen. I&amp;rsquo;m not stopping now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mile 5.5 - 6:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending too much time indoors lately, so I get my tan on with the mid-morning sun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mile 6:&lt;/strong&gt; Turn the last corner. Time to sprint home. I only go about 100 meters before the dry-heaving starts again. Ha! There&amp;rsquo;s nothing left in there now stomach! I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m going to pass out. Stop 0.1 miles from the finish. Friendly racer gives me a boost. Look up and see that yoga pants and tutu has passed me. No!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mile 6.2:&lt;/strong&gt; Full sprint and finish ahead of her. It&amp;rsquo;s over. Final time 54:16. I was shooting for 48:00 but that&amp;rsquo;s good enough for now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next stop:&lt;/strong&gt; Nationwide Half Marathon in October.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Backpacking Through Life</title>

        <guid>http://ishmeetgrewal.com/p/backpacking-through-life/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This year has been good to me. I have visited three countries and stepped on another continent. I have met a lot of new people and made some great new friends. Many new experiences have enriched my life and given me a better perspective of the world, of people, and of myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-did-i-write-this&#34;&gt;Why did I write this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve read the first paragraph, clearly, I know everything about the world. Anything I say must be pure words of wisdom handed down from the mountain itself and you should listen to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. That&amp;rsquo;s not it. This post is not about me telling you how to live your life. It&amp;rsquo;s not about preaching the real truth of life. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any answers to life&amp;rsquo;s troubles and I don&amp;rsquo;t know why your dog suddenly starts barking in the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I am reflecting upon and sharing the many new experiences I have had this year. I am not trying to start an argument, rather I am looking for a conversation which can help me learn even more. So please, I urge you to take part. Thank you for reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;up-in-the-air&#34;&gt;Up in the Air&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched Up in the Air on the flight that took me to the southern hemisphere for the first time, to Australia. I had originally watched the movie when it came out in 2009. But in 2009, I was a skinny high school freshman with a few hairs on my chain and reading Twilight alone at the lunch table. So what did I know? The second time around, a lot of things stood out in the movie, specifically Ryan Bingham&amp;rsquo;s motivational speech. It did what is was supposed to, it motivated me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan flies around the country and helps companies lay off their employees. He spends a majority of his year in airports and in flights. Additionaly, he is also a motivational speaker and he talks about backpacks, hence the title of this post. If you are not familiar with the movie, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsRP9EUrXjo&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;here&amp;rsquo;s the link to the video&lt;/a&gt;. But if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to watch it, I&amp;rsquo;ve included a transcript as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s In Your Backpack?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How much does your life weigh?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine for a second that you’re carrying a backpack. I want you to feel the straps on your shoulders. Feel ’em?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I want you to pack it with all the stuff that you have in your life. You start with the little things. The things on shelves and in drawers, the knick-knacks, the collectibles. Feel the weight as that adds up. Then you start adding larger stuff, clothes, table-top appliances, lamps, linens, your TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backpack should be getting pretty heavy now. And you go bigger. Your couch, bed, your kitchen table. Stuff it all in there. Your car, get it in there. Your home, whether it’s a studio apartment or a two bedroom house. I want you to stuff it all into that backpack. Now try to walk. It’s kind of hard, isn’t it? This is what we do to ourselves on a daily basis. We weigh ourselves down until we can’t even move. And make no mistake, moving is living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m gonna set that backpack on fire. What do you want to take out of it? What do you want to take out of it? Photos? Photos are for people who can’t remember. Drink some ginkgo and let the photos burn. In fact, let everything burn and imagine waking up tomorrow with nothing. It’s kind of exhilarating, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this is gonna be a little difficult, so stay with me. You have a new backpack. Only this time, I want you to fill it with people. Start with casual acquaintances, friends of friends, folks around the office, and then you move into the people that you trust with your most intimate secrets. Your cousins, your aunts, your uncles, your brothers, your sisters, your parents &amp;gt;and finally your husband, your wife, your boyfriend or your girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get them into that backpack. And don’t worry. I’m not gonna ask you to light it on fire. Feel the weight of that bag. Make no mistake – your relationships are the heaviest components in your life. Do you feel the straps cutting into your shoulders?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All those negotiations and arguments, and secrets and compromises. You don’t need to carry all that weight. Why don’t you set that bag down? Some animals were meant to carry each other, to live symbiotically for a lifetime – star crossed lovers, monogamous swans. We are not those animals. The slower we move, the faster we die. We are not swans. We’re sharks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;em&gt;Up in the Air&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan makes some really good points here. &amp;ldquo;The slower we move, the faster we die.&amp;rdquo; I immediately connected with him because I have the same mindset. I’m independent. I can live on my own. I don’t need relationships. I don’t need to rely on family or friends. If they need me I am available, but I don’t need anything from anyone. I was ready to shed the weight and put the bag down. At least that’s what I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He tells you to empty your backpack and leave it behind. I’m going to tell you something different. I say you should fill the backpack and take it with you everywhere. But, it is important what you put in the bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;collect-experiences-not-things-memories-not-souvenirs&#34;&gt;Collect experiences, not things, memories, not souvenirs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, we are not going to take anything with us. The only thing we will leave behind is our legacy. Invest in that legacy and invest yourself in collecting experiences that you can share and leave behind for your children and grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is vast. There is so much information and so many things to learn that it is impossible to do everything in one lifetime. I love and live to learn. I&amp;rsquo;m not content with what I know because it will never be enough to help me understand the world, people, or life. So how do I learn? Books, the internet, etc. But I also talk to people. In my travels, I&amp;rsquo;ve met a lot of new people and learning their life stories and sharing their perspective has in turn broadened mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few experiences and memories that I have in my backpack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-time-when-jesus-brought-me-back-my-gopro&#34;&gt;The time when Jesus brought me back my GoPro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, right? You&amp;rsquo;re intrigued. You don&amp;rsquo;t care that I have a GoPro, but you do want to know why Jesus brought it back and how in the world did you possibly miss the second coming? The GoPro is a thing, but the story is what I carry around in my backpack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was whitewater rafting in the beautiful, clean Rio Savegre in Costa Rica. We came to a pool where we jumped off the rafts and swam around for a bit. AS I was getting back in the raft, the GoPro that was on my chest clipped off and sank to the bottom of the pool. I immediately let it be known that I had lost it, but there was nothing to be done. The action camera disapperead with memories from the past few days. We continued on the adventure and after the trip ended, drove two hours to our next destination: the gorgeous Uvita beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
		
		&lt;figcaption&gt;Uvita beach. I don’t have any pictures of Jesus but you all know what he looks like.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
		
	&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, I returned from surfing in the Pacific Ocean and the GoPro was on the desk next to my bed. It turns out that one of our rafting guides had driven back an hour to the pool after the trip, and then the next day he hopped on his bike and rode two more hours to the beach and returned my camera. His name was Jesús.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one asked Jesús to do what he did, but he did it anyway. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking for a reward, he was just being a human being and helping someone out. I will carry that with me for the rest of my life. I will be selfless and help people when I can, even if that means going out of my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-phd-in-electrical-engineering-is-growing-crops-on-a-mountain&#34;&gt;A PhD in Electrical Engineering is growing crops on a mountain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Chris Ratcliff spent a lot of time and money in obtaining a PhD in Electrical Engineering. He spent years working on silicon conductor research in a dark basement. But today, he is a volunteer at the Montana de Luz orphanage in Honduras and is focusing on sustainable agriculture to provide healthy food for the children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would he make this decision? If you were to visit the orphanage, you will understand immediately. The children have difficult lives, they are struggling with one of the worst diseases to afflict humanity, HIV/AIDS. But if you look at their glowing faces and bright smiles as they run around the yard playing football or midnight tag with ring lights on their fingers, they look like the happiest human beings on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;figcaption&gt;Chris is happy where he is.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
		
	&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Chris realizes this. To him, a well paying job working in a fancy laboratory or teaching at a prestigious academic institution doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold a candle to when he picks up little Erik and puts him on his shoulders. The bright joy that lights up his face is evidence of this. It&amp;rsquo;s never too late to do what makes you happy. Having Chris&amp;rsquo;s story in my backpack is a great comfort and encouragement as I search for what makes me happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;an-italian-art-curator-left-everything-behind-and-found-love-in-fiji&#34;&gt;An Italian art curator left everything behind and found love in Fiji&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in Australia in May, I met two of the most amazing people I&amp;rsquo;ve come across in life. Anthony and Marina, our tour guides through the land down under taught me a lot over the span of three weeks. Unlike me, they&amp;rsquo;re not ones to talk about their life or experiences or share wisdom until prodded, but that is exactly what I tried to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marina left Italy and arrived in Fiji at the age of 35. Anthony met her on a beach and made her a cup of coffee. A year later they were married. Believe me, Anthony has made me a cup or two of coffee too, and if Marina hadn&amp;rsquo;t already claimed him&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthony and Marina live for experiences, they don&amp;rsquo;t care much for materialistic possessions, and they&amp;rsquo;re absolutely in love. They&amp;rsquo;re caring, resourceful, friendly, and absolutely the most genuine people I have met. They took us around the continent, cooking for us, helping us discover beautiful places and new activities, and supporting us the whole way. The experience would not have been the same without them, and as a future trip leader at the Outdoor Adventure Center at OSU, I learned a lot from their leading style. But most importantly, I learned that life can take you wonderful places and help you meet wonderful people, no matter which stage you&amp;rsquo;re in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-fathers-backpack-is-full&#34;&gt;My father&amp;rsquo;s backpack is full&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day I found a thank you letter I had written in eigth grade English class. It was to my father, but I never let him read it. I wrote about everything he had been through in life and thanked him for always being there for me and being an excellent mentor.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father is my complete opposite. I&amp;rsquo;m ready to drop my backpack and leave, but he chooses to stay. When my grandfather was ill, my dad was there caring for him until he passed away. When my grandmother was ill, my dad was there caring for her until she passed away. My dad was there by my mother&amp;rsquo;s side as she battled cancer for ten years, and he was there when she passed away. He brought me to America and we moved in with my aunt. When my uncle tragically passed away, my dad was there by my aunt&amp;rsquo;s side, and still is to this day. He simply will not leave, because he knows what is important to him. He had multiple opportunties, but never did he drop his backpack and run. I am learning from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;take-a-full-backpack-on-this-grand-adventure-called-life&#34;&gt;Take a full backpack on this grand adventure called life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think that living free and without people or things tying you down was the way to go. &amp;ldquo;The slower we move, the faster we die,&amp;rdquo; right? No. My family is the most important thing to me. They may not agree because I have an inability to express my feelings properly, the usual, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be where I am without every single thing everyone has done for me. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the person I am without all the people I have come across. So I choose to keep them in my backpack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my backpack is full of relationships, experiences, memories, and lessons learned from everyone I&amp;rsquo;ve met in my life, life is a lot easier. When I end up in a new place with no one to rely on but my backpack, and it&amp;rsquo;s bursting at the seams, everything becomes alright.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://ishmeetgrewal.com/p/honduras/honduras-cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Honduras" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I participated in an Engineering Service-Learning course through OSU where we traveled to Honduras over Spring Break 2015 and implemented sustainable engineering solutions for an orphanage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Montaña de Luz (Mountain of Light), is an orphanage for children with HIV/AIDS. Founded in 2000 as a Hospice, the orphanage has now become a loving home providing hope for these children thanks to the availability of anti-retroviral mediactions. Located an hour and half to the East of Tegucigalpa on top of a mountain overlooking a valley of small towns and sugar cane fields the mountain of light is a refuge for children who desperately need the specialized care, nurturance, healing and love provided to them in this refuge from a world where AIDS is stigmatizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our class had three student teams that worked on different projects. The Water Team installed bio-sand filters at the orphanage and conducted water quality tests in an ongoing effort to bring clean drinking water to MdL. Currently, MdL pays for bottled water which ends up costing them a lot of money every year. The Drip Irrigation Team installed a drip irrigation system which will help to start a vegetable garden to provide MdL with fruits and vegetables. The Electrical Team rebuilt an old backup generator and provided backup emergency power to the kitchen to help preserve food and medicines during power outages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 10 days, I made a lot of new friends, learned so much more about the important things in life, and played a lot of football. This is an experience I will cherish forever, and although no words will be able to communicate its value, I have tried to journal my experience in a &amp;lsquo;few&amp;rsquo; paragraphs below. I took me multiple days to write this post, so take your time in reading it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-1&#34;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four students, a GTA, and a teacher piled into a Yukon XL Uber along with our luggage at the comfortable hour of 3 a.m. and headed to the airport. Upon arrival, we checked in all our equipment bins and waited at our gate. In preparing for the trip, we had been communicating with a long term volunteer at the MdL named &lt;strong&gt;Chris&lt;/strong&gt;. While waiting to board, a couple overheard us and introduced themselves as Chris&amp;rsquo;s parents! They were headed to Belize via Miami. We connected in Miami and boarded the flight to Honduras. The airport in Tegucigalpa is neslted in the mountains with a short runway. So some passengers were concerned when the captain turned on the PA and informed us that he will be descending rapidly and breaking hard. We arrived safely, picked up our luggage and went through cutoms. Immediately we were greeted with warm weather and Applebee&amp;rsquo;s and Forever 21 franchises. We met up with &lt;strong&gt;Ruth&lt;/strong&gt;, the service team director who was going to be our guide in Honduras for the next 10 days. The currency exchange took place with a guy standing in the middle of the airport floor with a giant wad of cash in one hand and a calculator in the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We boarded a bus with our armed guard and started towards Montaña de Luz. Tegucigalpa was reminiscent of Costa Rica and India. Chaos and development interspersed among each other and everyone living their lives without a care. Traffic carried a similar sentiment. We stopped for dinner at a pizza place that served up some delicious pina coladas and local brews with an exceptional pizza. After dinner, we arrived at Montaña de Luz and were introduced to the kids. After learning everyone&amp;rsquo;s names and immediately forgetting them, we proceeded to settle into our living quarters and then played soccer for a bit. Over the next 10 days, we came to know these children as our siblings and I will never forget any of their names for the rest of my life. The night ended with gazing at the beautiful stars, playing with the puppy named Sacha and making sure our mosquito nets were secured before dozing off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-2---march-14&#34;&gt;Day 2 - March 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pie Day! We wanted to wake up early to watch the sunrise but the previous day&amp;rsquo;s travels had been too tiring. Breakfast was self-served cereal and fresh fruit. We gave Chris, Kristen (the MdL director), and Jorge (the renaissance man of MdL) an overview of our projects and got ready to work. After unpacking our tools, we brought out the two generators from storage and started disassembling them. One of them seemed to be in good condition, while the other had turned into a rat&amp;rsquo;s nest. We decided on repairing the generator that was in better condition first. We discovered that most of the fuel system pipes and tubes were corroded and some were missing, but we were able to piece together the puzzle and the layout of the entire fuel system. We had brought some polyetheylene tubes with us which luckily turned out to be the correct diameters. So we assembled the fuel system back together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we had to wait for diesel fuel to test the generator, so we called it an early day and played soccer with the kids. The Gringos played against the kids, and we lost. Sacha, the dog, was teething, so when I went to pet her, she bit me and drew blood. Later, there was talk of rabies shots, but I was assuaged with the fact that Sacha was up to date on her vet visits. After dinner, the children had prepared a presentation on HIV/AIDS for us. Through interactive presentations and activities, they informed us about the disease, symptoms and current cures. I got to learn a lot more about a disease that is a serious global problem and I had never given it too much thought before. It made me see their situation in a whole new light. At night, I noticed that the toilet paper in the bathroom was labeled &amp;ldquo;Vaya con Dios&amp;rdquo; (Go with God). Of course, it was 1-ply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-3---free-day&#34;&gt;Day 3 - Free Day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We missed the sunrise again and vowed to wake up even earlier the next day. Today was a free day and we traveled to Parque de Picacho, a huge park overlooking the capital city Tegucigalpa. We went ziplining and then later walked around the park through a hall of mirrors, got some ice cream, took pictures with Big Jesus, and explored the park. Before leaving, we stopped at a street stand to pick up some mango slices sprinkled with red chilli and vinegar! A perfect delicious snack to end the visit to the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ate lunch in a neighborhood called Santa Lucia and I devoured the beef, chicken, and chorizo plate along with some sweet Maracuya juice. We proceeded to Villa de Angeles to do some souvenir shopping and added some magnets, hammocks, cigars, flags, and lots of sweets to our collection. When we returned from our trip, the kids were esctatic to see us. We played some games with them and then proceeded to hang out in the hammocks outside the dining room. This was to become a daily ritual where we unwound at the end of the day and shared a myriad of stories among each other. This particular night involved the discussion of some local MdL ghost tales and planning of pranks. The unfortunate target of our first (and it turns out only) prank was our teacher. While he was in the shower, we took away the mattress from his room and left him the box spring. We were expecting him to come storming out and complaining, but before long, he was deep asleep on the box spring without even noticing and we all retired to our comfortable beds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-4&#34;&gt;Day 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finally caught the sunrise over the mountain and it was absolutely gorgeous! We played with the children and tried to communicate in our broken Spanish before they left for school. The rest of the morning was spent avoiding John, our teacher, for fear of cracking up in front of him and spilling the beans about the whole operation. We felt really bad when he mentioned that he woke up in the middle of the night and couldn&amp;rsquo;t breathe and had to sleep on the floor, but the show must go on. Jorge had gotten us some diesel, so we poured it into the generator and a lot of leaks sprung up. We proceeded to patch them but had to drain the fuel tank a few times, which was a slow, time consuming process. Finally, we attached the battery and fired the baby up. The sweet sweet sound of the engine sputtering to life attracted everyone from the compound and high fives went around. Success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, after we turned it off, white smoke came out of the body and we determined that the polyethylene tubes were not capable of withstanding the heat and some of them had melted off. We got extremely lucky again as the generator could have turned into a grenade with the high temperatures and fuel dripping everywhere. We hopped in the van with Jorge and went hunting for other fuel tubes at the local Ferreterías (hardware store). We got extremely lucky yet again and found the exact thing we wanted at the third store. The work day was almost over so we came back and quickly replaced the plastic tubes with the rubber ones and wrapped up for the day. In the evening, we played some games with the children and then, of course, fútbol! After dinner, we went down the street to the teenage boys&#39; house and played some card games with them. During the day, a whole truck load of watermelons had been donated to MdL. From this day on, we ate watermelon with every meal. We finally ended the prank on John as we didn&amp;rsquo;t want him to sleep on the floor again and went to bed anxious about his plans for revenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-5&#34;&gt;Day 5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Saint Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Day! After breakfast, we started the generator again and fixed final leaks and fuel system problems. We also observed that some of the wires were melted and were drawing current from the battery even when the generator wasn&amp;rsquo;t on. After replacing the wiring and troubleshooting more electical issues, we put the generator housing back and started on the process of integrating the generator with the kitchen&amp;rsquo;s electrical grid. We found a suitable place to house the generator and measured the appropriate length of wire needed to reach the kitchen circuit breaker box. The rest of the day involved staying up on ladders and drilling/chiseling holes into walls to get the wire from the generator shed to the kitchen. At the end of the day, we had completed the layout and only needed to connect everything the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a snack of watermelon slices, we helped the children make Father&amp;rsquo;s Day cards for all the dads at MdL. Then we played some water balloon toss with the kids. Samuel and I were winning and successfully tossing the ballon from 30 feet away when he just grinned from ear to ear and chucked the balloon at his neighbor. Many a balloon was lost in the ensuing chaos. More fútbol followed. Deri and Omar, two of the older boys came down and played with us. Deri just got selected to the Honduras national team. During our game, he was just stepping around everyone and giggling while he went past us and scored. I stole the ball from him once while defending. So when he shows up in the World Cup some day, I&amp;rsquo;ll have this to brag about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole had her eighteenth birthday today, and as a tradition, the birthday boy/girl has to be doused in ridiculous amounts of water. Water War #2 of the day started up and everyone got drenched. It was a lot of fun. Afterwards, we relaxed in the hammocks and planned future trips as a group, Euro 2016 being the popular choice. While we were in the hammocks, the sky turned red. We sprinted to the water tower and observed a distant sugarcane field on fire. The huge blaze literally lit up the night sky and burned out as soon as it had began. The dreams were good and trippy this night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-6&#34;&gt;Day 6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finished laying out the wiring and installed the transfer switch in the kitchen. Our generator was rated to power everything in the kitchen but the electric stove, which required too much electrical current. So, we isolated the circuits necessary and then bypassed them through the transfer switch. This way, when the power went out, the generator could be turned on and the transfer switch would allow the kitchen to receive power. When the power came back on, the only step necessary was to turn the transfer switch back to main power and turn off the generator. After all the installations, we tested the system and it was successful! More high fives all around and then we cleaned up the mess we made in the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinner today was at a former Tia&amp;rsquo;s house. Tias (Aunts) take care of the children at the orphanage. She let us make our own tortillas and while we were waiting for dinner to cook, her daughter Jennifer serenaded us with some songs she wrote. The acoustic guitar, the beautiful voice, the starry night, and the smell of the cooking dinner just made it a wholesome experience. We thanked our hosts for their hospitality walked back to MdL. The children had gone to bed and it was late, so no fútbol today. We relaxed in the hammocks, chatted for a bit, and called it a night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-7&#34;&gt;Day 7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the generator wired in and working, we slept in today and worked on creating documentation for operating the generator and keeping it in good repair. We also investigated repairing the second spare generator, but we did not have enough spare parts and that generator was in a much worse condition. A student from last year&amp;rsquo;s trip had accompanied us this year because her project had malfunctioned. She was trying to install a wind turbine on top of the water tower. We helped her with the electrical wiring and installation in between hammock breaks. Today was the last work day, so at the end of the day, we gathered everyone from the compound and gave them demoes of our projects. During our demonstration, faces lit up along with kitchen lights that were powered by our repaired generator. The drip irrigation and the water team had also done tremendous work. The drip team had installed a drip irrigation system which would help Chris get started with his vegetable garden. The water team had installed bio-sand filters and run water quality tests in an ongoing effort to bring safe drinking water to the MdL. All of our accomplishments filled us with complete joy and we basked in the sense of a job well done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Crystal&amp;rsquo;s birthday today, and after singing to her, we got to enjoy some homemade cake. After that we played more fútbol! Maybe it was the excitement of finishing our project, but I ran a lot more today and bashed my head into a tree and into John&amp;rsquo;s nose and ended up bleeding from both ears. After some clean up and dinner, Chris brought out his Light-Up Frisbee and we played in the dark. It was a whole new experience. We could hardly see anyone and would just throw the frisbee in a general direction and it would be snatched up by a hand out of thin air. After about an hour of frisbee, we got in some hammock time and said our buenas noches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-8---beach-day&#34;&gt;Day 8 - Beach Day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was our second free day, and we were headed to the beach! We woke up at the early hour of 4 a.m. and piled into the bus for a four hour drive to Coyolito, located on the southern tip of Honduras. From Coyolito, we rode a ferry to the volcanic island of Amapala, which had a small, beautiful beach and a population of about 3000 people. This island was in a unique location because you could see El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua from one place! If only I could have just taken a boat over, I could have added those two countries to my list as well. We had the whole beach to ourselves in the beginning, and immediately started throwing around a frisbee and kicking around a fútbol. The beach slowly filled up, and we started up a game with the locals. Initially we divided up the teams with a mix of Gringos and Hondureños. The Hondurans were ridiculously good. Kiko, a kid who was smaller than my leg was much much better than me at football. After about half an hour, we switched up the teams and decided to go Hodnureños vs Gringos. After an intense game, we actually ended up winning 1-0!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exhausted from the match, we jumped in the water and the food we had ordered earlier showed up. Fresh breaded garlic shrimp with some local brews made an absolutely exquisite meal. The locals had gone out fishing and returned with a boat full of fresh fish and hammerheads. Kiko just jumped into the boat and started gutting the fish with a knife. I want to be that kid when I grow up. Soon, it was time to head back because we had to return to the orphanage before sundown and had a four hour drive back. Back on the mainland, we purchased some coconuts and other drinks. We had brought a few watermelons with us to the beach but didn&amp;rsquo;t end up eating them. So I gave away one to a grubby kid standing around watching us throw back refreshing drinks. His face lit up like none other, and that moment alone made this trip amazing for me. He sprinted to his family with the watermelon and waved at us until our bus was out of sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the long ride back, we jammed to tunes and reminisced about the amazing week we just had. On the way back, some of us also purchased hammocks from the roadside market. The children were ecstatic and jumped into out arms as soon as we got back to MdL. After dinner and some hammock time, exhausted, we all fell into deep sleeps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-9---match-day&#34;&gt;Day 9 - Match Day!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good hearty breakfast fueled us for our fútbol match against the locals today. Everyone from MdL walked down to Nueva Esperanza for the football tournament. Playing football daily for a whole week had prepared us for this moment, and team Gringos had their positions already figured out. We created a formation and stuck to it. The older MdL boys along with the guards made up the Honduran team. The eight on eight match went on for an hour and we held our own for the first half, only letting in one goal and having numerous shots on goal. In the past years, the Gringos had been beaten by upwards of 8-0, and the Honduran team was very surprised at our performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second half, we mixed in some local Hondureños and played just as hard to end the match with a Honduran win at 4-3. All in all, it was probably the best football match I&amp;rsquo;ve played in. After some refreshments and more watermelon, the women&amp;rsquo;s team went on the field and they played until both teams scored a goal. After cleaning up and saying goodbyes to the locals, we all walked back to MdL and visited numerous Pulperías (local shops) on the way to grab snack and drinks. Upon getting back, we found out that the power had gone out. Electrical Team to the Rescue! We started up the generator and lunch was saved! After lunch, I went along with Ruth to the gas station to get bags of ice and while I was there, I also indulged in some ice cream and strawberry milkshakes. We put the ice bags in the freezer that was on, thanks to the generator, and afterwards Ruth took a few of us around the town to give us a little tour. We visited the cemetery where some of the MdL children were buried. Ruth told us that every year they have a ceremony where they ask Kevin to say a few words. Kevin has been at MdL from day one and he is the only one who has known everyone who came to MdL, and everyone who went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we returned to MdL, it was time to make homemade ice cream with the children. The Electrical Team saved the activity, because the ice was still frozen! We set up an assembly line and made our own ice cream. After mixing milk, sugar, and vanilla in a ziploc bag and placing it in a larger ziploc bag with ice, a spoon of salt was added. After much shaking of the bags, and some science, the children were happily munching away at their ice cream with satisfied grins. They also took the chance to grab fistfuls of ice and put them in the back of our shirts. Then we set up the chairs in a circle and everyone at MdL signed our shirts with their names and heartfelt messages. After dinner, we spent more time with the children. We were out in the front playing some fútbol and Ruth brought out a bag of ring lights. All of a sudden, six year old Erick ran around the compound yelling &amp;ldquo;Luzes, Luzes, Luzes&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;Lights, Lights, Lights&amp;rdquo;), informing everyone of this brand new development. It was the cutest thing I have ever seen. We all put on the ring lights and had a dance party in the field. After that, we played freeze tag and it was the best night of the whole week. Just running around the place without a care in the world and enjoying life was the best thing ever. We did our final reflection in the Chapel and then relaxed in the hammocks, trying to come up with excuses to never leave this amazing place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, we had breakfast and joined the children for their morning prayers. After that, we said our goodbyes. Lots of hugging and crying was involved. The trip back to Tegucigalpa and then Houston and then Columbus was uneventful, and another 10 amazing days in paradise had come to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;thanks-a-lot-for-reading&#34;&gt;Thanks a lot for reading!&lt;/h3&gt;

        <title>Costa Rica</title>

        <pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://ishmeetgrewal.com/p/costa-rica/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://ishmeetgrewal.com/p/costa-rica/costa-rica-feature.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Costa Rica" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spent 10 days in Costa Rica with a group on a Service-Adventure trip through Buck-I-SERV at OSU. This ended up being mostly an adventure trip. We started off by hiking seven miles into the rainforest where we spent five days staying with homestays, helping out with daily tasks, and maintaining trails. Along the way, we went caving, waterfall rappelling, tree climbing, and whitewater rafting, along with a LOT of hiking. We ended the trip by going to Uvita National Park where we learned how to surf and cleaned up the beach. This was the essence of our itinerary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-thoughts&#34;&gt;My thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why was this the best time I have spent anywhere in my life? Mainly because of the views. From day one, this country provided my eyes awesome vistas to feast on, and it kept getting better everyday. The mountains, the clouds, the greenery, the rainforests, the rivers, the ocean, the beach, the flora and the fauna, everything was gorgeous and made me question if I had died and gone to heaven. Seriously, there was not a single point during my trip that I didn&amp;rsquo;t look around and marvel at this beautiful country and wonder what I had done to be so lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people were even better. The nicest most loving people who invited us into their homes, answered all our questions, fed us generously without wasting anything and made this trip that much better for it. Every single person we met was nicer than the last. At one point, when one of our group members became sick and went to the hospital with our tour guide, our surfing instructor helped us get groceries and cook dinner where we would have been lost by ourselves. Beautiful country and beautiful people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a huge interest toward sustainable living. Costa Rica is the most sustainable country on Earth, with 80% of their energy coming from renewable sources. Seeing this sustainable culture evident in the way people live was pretty awesome. They fed our group of 12 three times a day for 5 days, and at the end of every meal, everyone was full and nothing was wasted. I marvel at their skill for portioning. The conserved everything, recycled everything, and wasted nothing. It was an awesome experience watching this new way of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-1&#34;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived at Port Columbus Airport bright and early at 4am and learned that our flight to Houston was severely delayed, which would make us miss our connection to San Jose, Costa Rica. Our trip leader Hailey arranged new flights for us via Newark, but this meant a significant delay in getting to Costa Rica. We encountered problems again in Newark when the desk agent told us that there wasn’t enough space on the plane and some of us might have to get to Costa Rica indirectly via Panama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, all of us piled on the plane and departed for San Jose, arriving late at midnight. All in all, we spent 20 hours in airports uncomfortably catching up on sleep, eating airport food and playing games to get to know the group better. Our guide Carlos picked us up from the airport in San Jose and took us to the Hostel Pangea where we spent four hours sleeping after a quick dinner of Hamburgers and Iced Tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-2&#34;&gt;Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 2 started at 5am when we packed into a bus to drive to Carlos’s office HQ in San Isidro del General stopping for a breakfast buffet of plantains, pancakes, eggs, fried cheese, and rice and beans. Upon arriving at Carlos’s office, we lightened our packs and dropped off some non-essential items and drove another hour through winding mountain roads to the second highest point in Costa Rica. Carlos&amp;rsquo;s son Ernesto was accompanying us and he was trying to learn English. So I made a pact with him that I will talk to him in Spanish and he has to reply in English. He agreed and we both worked on our languages the rest of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The views on this drive enthralled us all, where at one point we were driving on a ridge with deep lush green valleys on both sides and mountains as far as the eye could say and the Pacific Ocean glittering on the horizon. We arrived in the town of Brujo, unloaded our packs from the bus, loaded them on to our shoulders and set off into the rainforest for a 7 mile hike to Carlos’s brother’s house. On the way we had to climb a relentless 1km uphill mountain that seemed like it went on forever. The painful ascent was worth it, because the views just kept getting better every meter we climbed. Dear reader, accept this, no matter how much flowering language I use or how many pictures I show you, I will never be able to truly capture the beauty of Costa Rica for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived at Hernan’s house in the mountains around 5pm. Hernan has been living here for 30 years and has built everything himself. The house was gorgeous and equipped with a kitchen, living area, and guest rooms for travelers like us. Hernan had built two showers and toilets just outside, and a living cabin for the main family as well. After washing up in the refreshing river and showers, we had dinner of rice and beans, plantains and fried cheese with some guava juice. The sun had set at 5:30pm and tired from our long day of hiking, we all retired to our beds soon after dinner and a group reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-3&#34;&gt;Day 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roosters woke me up at 4:30am and after using the bathroom, I took a walk around the compound discovering the chickens, the cows, the banana farm and then went down to the river to take a cold morning plunge. Watching the world wake up around me, the beauty of this country grew even more in my eyes. We had breakfast which contained more rice and beans along with eggs, fresh pineapple, coffee and hot chocolate. Every meal included gallo pinto, a traditional dish of rice and beans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was our service day, and we split up into two groups and my group went back to restore the trail we had used yesterday. Overgrowth had narrowed the trail and rains had deposited lots of rocks which had made our trek yesterday quite difficult and dangerous. Widening the trail and clearing it was grueling work, but I kept at it because I realized that even if it had been difficult for me to hike this trail, at least it would make someone&amp;rsquo;s hike in the future a lot easier. Every time I got tired, I stopped and looked around for a few seconds at the beautiful mountains and wondered how I got so lucky. Then I went right back to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We came back to the house at lunch time, swam in the river and napped in the afternoon. In the evening, we went out to Hernan&amp;rsquo;s banana farm and in addition to learning how banana&amp;rsquo;s grow, we got to harvest a few bunches by using machetes. Hernan also had a small sugarcane farm and grew various fruits on his property like pineapples, oranges, guavas, and cocoa beans. We tasted samples of each refreshing tropical fruit and then went back inside to help make some banana bread and home made cheese. After dinner, we talked with Hernan about his life in the mountains and learned more about the culture of the Ticos (Costa Ricans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costa Rica is the most sustainable country on Earth, with 80% of their energy coming from renewable sources. This sustainable culture is evident in the way the Ticos live, they waste nothing and conserve everything. After days of living with homestays, they were able to portion every single meal so that everyone was full and nothing was wasted. Any food trash went to the animals. It was a truly remarkable way that they lived. The sun set every day around 5:30, but the Costa Rican government had provided subsidized solar cells that charged a 12 volt battery in the house that powered a few light bulbs and the occasional washing machine when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-4&#34;&gt;Day 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up a little earlier than the usual 4:30 am in order to catch Hernan before he went to milk the cows. In my broken Spanish, I asked him if I could come along and we went looking for the four cows that were out in the pasture. I also planted my GoPro out in the pasture to capture a timelapse of the sun lighting up the mountains. We gathered the cows and herded them into the barn, where we tied up their legs and tail in order to avoid being kicked in the face and I proceeded to milk my first cow. It was quite an experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After breakfast, we said goodbye to Hernan and his family and hiked another 45 minutes to our next homestay with Lupe (6) and Diego (9) and their mother. This house was a little small, so we had to leave all our stuff on the porch, but the views were just as glorious. After a quick break, we grabbed our water bottles and headlamps and climbed another tall mountain to reach a 900 foot deep cave. Lupe and Diego came along with us and darted ahead of everyone. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t my first caving experience, so I went with Diego, Lupe, and the dog Capitan and we explored the cave while the others had formed a train of clutched shirts and shoulders and were carefully navigating the muddy floor cursing at the cave&amp;rsquo;s wildlife. There were spiders and crickets the size of my hand everywhere and bats (murcielagos) that kept flying at us. I didn&amp;rsquo;t learn until reflection later that day, but apparently the cave was not everyone&amp;rsquo;s best experience. Anyway, I had a blast. At the end of the cave was a column of stalactites and stalagmites which was beautiful. We turned off our headlamps and experienced total darkness, during which the dog Capitan brushed up against a girl&amp;rsquo;s leg and caused much chaos. We returned from the cave and had a swim session in the river and also washed off the clay from our shoes and clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch was more rice and beans and we took some naps on the porch afterwards and played some cards. In the evening, we went over to a field nearby and met up with a group from Ohio University that was in the same program as us, but a day ahead. OSU played soccer against OU and lost, mostly due to the many Ticos that played on the OU side. Exhausted after the game, we freshened up and helped Lupe and Diego&amp;rsquo;s mom cook dinner. After some post-dinner games, popcorn, and daily reflection, we retired to the porch for the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-5&#34;&gt;Day 5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I slept like a rock, but apparently no one else did. After breakfast, we grabbed our GoPros and hiked 30 minutes to a waterfall and rappelled down it. Have I mentioned how beautiful the views in this country are? Well, they kept getting better. We rappelled down in groups of fours, with Carlos backup belaying us from the top of the waterfall. Rappelling is when you tie a rope to your harness and then basically slide down the rope. Doing this next to a waterfall is that much magical. I was the last one to go, so naturally I asked Carlos if I could rappel down face first. He agreed, and I had the best time walking down a waterfall. How many people can say they&amp;rsquo;ve done that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After millions of pictures, we came back to the house, packed up everything and said goodbye to Lupe and Diego and hiked about 15 minutes to our next homestay, which was the house of Carlos&amp;rsquo;s in-laws. This was a pretty sweet house, open to air and built around rocks. There was a giant rock protruding out of the middle of the living room which gave the room a lot of character. Another rock at the back of the house created a huge Pride Rock platform that opened to a large field and mountains in the distance. Lion King could have been shot here. Carlos&amp;rsquo;s wife had 17 siblings, so his mother-in-law was used to feeding a lot of people. There were also a few other foreigners staying here. Zach and Chloe had arrived with a group from Appalachian State and had decided to stay. Madonna stopped by while hiking through. She had been a college professor who decided she needed more adventure in her life at age 49 and came down to Costa Rica where Carlos trained her to be a wilderness guide. Now she was taking her own groups around the beautiful country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlos&amp;rsquo;s father-in-law had a big sugarcane farm, so we helped to make sugar. We started by hand cranking a machine that squeezed sugarcane juice, then ran the husks through a motorized juicer that got even more juice out and boiled the juice for a few hours using the dried up sugarcane husks. The water evaporated and left the sugar, which was poured into cup molds and Carlos mixed some sugar with Peanut Butter and powdered milk and made candy for us. We relaxed a bit more, and talked a lot among the group and got to know each other much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-6&#34;&gt;Day 6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After breakfast, we started our hike back the way we had come and after about two hours and a cable car trip across the river, we arrived at the Rainforest Center, another homestay for groups like ours. We deposited our stuff at a cabin which had a beautiful view of the river and gathered in the main dining area for lunch. We were greeted with pancakes and guava jelly for desert after some fresh salad and fruits along with rice and beans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post Lunch, we went to climb a very large and tall tree in the compound, with Carlos belaying us. This activity was not in the original itinerary, and came as a welcome surprise to the enthusiastic climbers in our group, including me. After the tree climbing, we went to the sauna. The sauna was built by Albino, the resident medicine man and head of the household. It was a small stone room by the side of the river, with a drum converted into a furnace and an exhaust port. An ancient tradition suggested the use of the sauna to clean your body and mind. We all took a dip in the river and spent ten minutes in the sauna. This was repeated three times, first time to cleanse the body, second time to cleanse the mind, and the third time to cleanse the spirit. The whole procedure was done in complete silence. It was quite a peaceful experience, and I was thankful to Carlos for including it because I was starting to develop a headache and the sauna eradicated it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon our return from the Sauna, Albino took us around the compound and gave us a tour of all the plants that could be used as medicines here in this remote part of the rainforest where medical supplies were hard to come by. At dinner, we were greeted with another surprise: Pasta! We had been craving carbs the whole trip and now it was a dream come true. For desert, we fried dried up cocoa beans, ground them, and mixed them with sugar and powdered milk to make our very own chocolate which we savored with more pancakes. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t much to do tonight, so after a few card games, we called it an early night at 9pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-7&#34;&gt;Day 7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was rafting day! After a breakfast of rice and beans and pancakes with pineapple jelly, we started our hike back to where we had started on Day 2. The three hours went by very fast, with all of us singing songs and chattering away. We ended the hike with a group rendition of Carmen Ohio and then covered ourselves with sunscreen for the four hour rafting trip ahead. Two more guides, Jesus and Geraldo, had arrived with the rafts and a safety kayak. After a safety briefing, we jumped in the rafts and Carlos, Ernesto and Jesus took us out on the water. The rapids were only class 3, so not too bad. But the views from the river kept getting better and better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about two hours, we stopped for lunch on the river side. Carlos had told us we would be having sandwiches, and I had assumed PB&amp;amp;J&amp;rsquo;s or cold cuts wrapped on foil. But Carlos flipped a raft over to use as a table and started pulling out a feast from the barrels. FRESH BREAD! Turkey, ham, lettuce, chips and cookies. The guides sliced up fresh tomatoes, pickles, and pineapples, while our trip leader Hailey mad fresh guacamole. We literally had a feast. Sitting on the side of the river, looking up at the most beautiful view of the clouds and the mountains and enjoying the most delicious food, this is the best lunch I have ever had. Forget five star expensive restaurants, I could do this every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After filling up, we cleaned up and continued our expedition down river. We came to a beautiful waterfall and stopped to take pictures. Further along, we arrived at a deep pool where my raft turned into pirates and we boarded and sunk our neighboring raft. In the ensuing battle, my GoPro, which had been mounted on my chest harness, came off and fell in the water. I noticed five minutes later, and one of our guides said he could come and look for it later. I told him not to worry about it since my camera was free anyway. We finished the trip and at the end were reunited with our clean clothes that we had left at Carlos&amp;rsquo;s office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We piled into a bus and drove an hour to Uvita National Park, where we were to spend our next few days. The cabins we were staying in were only 200 yards away from the beach. We deposited our stuff and walked down to the beach just in time to catch a beautiful sunset over the Pacific Ocean. There was no one to cook for us at the cabins, but we had our own kitchen. I mixed up some delicious cole-slaw and we enjoyed it with hot dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-8&#34;&gt;Day 8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was surfing day! After a breakfast of fresh fruits and hot chocolate, we walked down to the beach and met our surfing instructors: another Carlos who was nicknamed Diablo (the devil), Genaro, Christian, and Jorge. A little bit about Uvita National Park. It is also known as Marino Balena National Park. Balena means whale, and from December - March, humpback whales come down to the waters off Uvita Beach to mate. During low tide, the waters recede enough that the rocks and reefs create a formation that looks like the whale&amp;rsquo;s tail. You can walk a kilometer into the Pacific Ocean during low tide, which we did. These waters are also the safest in Central America to learn how to surf, due to the regular slope and the absence of any rocks on the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a quick lesson in the basics, we headed into the water and started riding the waves back to the beach. After two practice runs, I was able to stand on the board, but fell off just as quickly. We surfed until lunch with regular breaks to hydrate. There was a point when I got up on the board and looked straight ahead. The coconut trees lined the beach as far as the eye could see, the mountains accented the trees in the background with little houses sprinkled on the slopes, the fluffy clouds sat on the mountains like hats and a slight fog made the entire sight dreamy. I was, quite literally, in paradise. Hands down the best beach I have ever been to. Since it was also a national park, it was largely devoid of people and we had it to ourselves. During low tide, we walked out on the Whale&amp;rsquo;s Tail and the views just kept getting better. We had sandwiches for lunch and returned to the beach for another bout of surfing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ohio University group was here, and it was there last day. They were drawing up a small soccer field on the beach and getting ready for a match. Ernesto and I joined them, and despite my skin color, I was put on the team of gringos. We didn&amp;rsquo;t fare bad, tying up the game at 5-5. When I got back for dinner, I discovered that our rafting tour guide had gone back, somehow found my GoPro in that pool, and driven an hour to drop it off with Carlos. So, Jesus found and returned my GoPro. It was truly a miracle. Needless to say, I left a hefty tip for Jesus with Carlos, and made plans to be baptized when I got back to America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-9&#34;&gt;Day 9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cleaned up the beach today, but since it was a national park and the cleanest beach I have been to, it took us less than an hour. Afterwards we went into the little town and bought souvenirs and I got my first Costa Rican colones. After more long walks along the beach, we came back and had lunch. The tide was not quite right for surfing yet, so instead some of us went to a local house where Genaro was helping Dave build some cabins. Dave was a former inventor from Canada who had retired to Costa Rica with his wife Susan and bought a piece of land right next to the beach. He added a pool, a volleyball court, a ping pong table, plenty of hammocks and a bombing music system. We relaxed, had a ping pong tourney, and played some v-ball games, all the while listening to Bob Marley and the Wailers. This was the life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thanked Dave for the hospitality and headed back to the beach with our boards. The second day of surfing was much more fun. We decided to do party waves, where multiple people would catch the same wave and ride it together. I got some good shots with my GoPro (this time it was triple reinforced to protect against being lost in the ocean). The views were still glorious, and the glee on people&amp;rsquo;s faces was also beautiful. We were truly having fun. After a few hours, we took our boards back to the cabins and returned for the sunset, which, due to the presence of clouds, was absolutely gorgeous. We cooked ourselves a dinner feast, with a BBQ where we grilled chicken, pork, onions and peppers and accompanied it with chips and guacamole. This was our last full day in Costa Rica, and it truly was an amazing one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning, after some reluctant goodbyes to Carlos and Ernesto, we piled in the bus which brought us back to San Jose and we flew back to the frigid temperatures of Columbus, Ohio after ten days in paradise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;thanks-a-lot-for-reading&#34;&gt;Thanks a lot for reading!&lt;/h3&gt;

        <title>Sikhism - The Tenets</title>
        <link>http://ishmeetgrewal.com/p/sikhism-tenets/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2014 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://ishmeetgrewal.com/p/sikhism-tenets/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sikhism is the 5th largest religion in the world and has been around since the 15th century. The Holy Book of Sikhism, known as Sri Guru Granth Sahib, is composed of 1,430 pages and contains the teachings of the ten Gurus on how to live a just and virtuous life. That is a lot of pages to read and understand. However, the essence of the message of Sikhism can truly be found in just the first nine phrases of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ik Onkar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;There is only one God and He is omnipresent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
God is omnipresent. This means that He is everywhere around us and even within us. Thus, if we believe in God and respect Him, we should treat everyone and everything with the same respect and kindness. We should not try to cheat people or be unjust towards anyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sat Nam&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;His name is true&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
God’s word is true, and He would never lie to us. So, whenever He tells us to do something, He is looking out for our best interests. We should also never lie and cheat and follow in God’s footsteps on the true path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karta Purkh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;He has created everything and everyone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
God is the creator and builder of this world and universe and he is omnipresent in it. Thus, we should treat everything from our planet to the people with the same reverence that is reserved for God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nir Bhau&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;He is without fear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
God does not fear anything, and since He is within us, we should also not fear anything, including Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nir Vaer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;He has no animosity or hatred towards anything&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
God loves everyone and everything, and we should do the same since He resides within us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Akal Murat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;He is immortal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Since He never dies, His teachings are eternal and can always be applied, regardless of place or time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ajuni&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;God is beyond birth and death&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We should not worry about the afterlife and just live our lives to the fullest in the present since we are simply the essence of God poured temporarily into mortal vessels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sai Bhang&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;He is self sustained&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
God does not need anything from us to sustain Him. We are a part of Him and all He asks of us is that we follow His teachings to live just and virtuous lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gur Prasad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;He is realized by following his teachings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If we follow the aforementioned advice, by His grace, we can realize God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a learned scholar of Sikhism, merely a Sikh, i.e., a disciple. I wrote this article to provide an overview of the very simple and practical teachings of Sikhism that really make sense without being entrenched in controversies of scripture or revelations. If we live our lives according to the above tenants, the world will be a much better place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I apologize for any mistakes on my part. Kindly provide feedback to correct them if necessary. Thanks!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Raspberry Pi Timelapse</title>
        <link>http://ishmeetgrewal.com/p/raspberry-pi-timelapse/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2014 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://ishmeetgrewal.com/p/raspberry-pi-timelapse/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This weekend, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.byersimports.com/index.htm&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Byers Imports&lt;/a&gt; unveiled the new &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.jaguarusa.com/all-models/f-type/f-type-models/f-type-coupe.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Jaguar F-Type Coupe&lt;/a&gt; and invited people to autocross for free. I set up a Raspberry Pi at the start line to record a picture every 10 seconds. It managed to capture every car that autocrossed and a pretty cool view of the moving clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://player.vimeo.com/video/106693628&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;vimeo video&#34; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;connect-the-camera&#34;&gt;Connect the camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The folks over at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/camera-module-setup/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt; have created a nice tutorial of how to setup the camera and connect it to Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/GImeVqHQzsE&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;enable-the-camera&#34;&gt;Enable the camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will assume that you know how to start up a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian and connect a monitor and keyboard/mouse to it. If not, some quick google searches should help you get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open a LXTerminal in Pi and open &lt;code&gt;raspi-config&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;sudo raspi-config
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select &lt;code&gt;Enable camera&lt;/code&gt; and hit &lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt;, then go to &lt;code&gt;Finish&lt;/code&gt; and you will be asked to reboot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;taking-pictures&#34;&gt;Taking pictures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;raspistill&lt;/code&gt; command is used to take pictures along with various configuration flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;raspistill -o test.jpg
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will place a &lt;code&gt;test.jpg&lt;/code&gt; file in your home folder. The &amp;lsquo;raspistill&amp;rsquo; command takes about six seconds to take a picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;timelapse-script&#34;&gt;Timelapse script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a simple python script to take a picture every ten seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;RPi.GPIO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;GPIO&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Determine the current date and time&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;startYear&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;%04d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;startMonth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;%02d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;month&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The code is pretty well commented, but I will delve into the actual capture image part. I have included some flags with the &lt;code&gt;raspistill&lt;/code&gt; command, and they are described below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Flag&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;-w&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;width&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;800&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;-h&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;height&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;600&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;-o&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;output file name&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;/path/to/file.jpg&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;-sh&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;sharpness&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;-awb&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;auto white balance&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;auto&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;-mm&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;metering mode&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;average&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;-ex&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;exposure&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;auto&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More detailed flag specifications are available &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/applications/camera.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;automatic-startup-on-boot&#34;&gt;Automatic startup on boot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make the Pi start taking pictures when it was powered on, I added a cron job to the crontab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navigate to the home directory in Pi using &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt;. Then, use &lt;code&gt;crontab -e&lt;/code&gt; and add the following command to the crontab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;@reboot python /path/to/timelapse/file.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;sudo shutdown -h &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;now&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will ensure that your &lt;code&gt;timelapse.py&lt;/code&gt; script will start running every time you reboot the Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;making-the-video&#34;&gt;Making the Video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install the &lt;code&gt;mencoder&lt;/code&gt; package that converts all the pictures into a video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;sudo apt-get install mencoder
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, navigate to your directory that has all the pictures and execute the following commands&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;/* This adds all the pictures to a list */
ls *.jpg stills.txt
/* Make the video */
mencoder -nosound -ovc lavc -lavcopts &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;vcodec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;mpeg4:aspect&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;16/9:vibrate&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;8000000&lt;/span&gt; -vf &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;1920:1080 -o timelapse.avi -mf &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;jpeg:fps&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;24&lt;/span&gt; mf://@stills.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you can copy the &lt;code&gt;timelapse.avi&lt;/code&gt; file from the Pi using a FTP client or from the SD card itself. Enjoy your video!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bonus---pi-remote-access&#34;&gt;BONUS! - Pi Remote Access&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of having to keep connecting the Pi to the monitor and keyboard and switching out the SD card every time I needed to copy files, I bought a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Edimax-EW-7811Un-Adapter-Raspberry-Supports/dp/B003MTTJOY/ref=lp_13983791_1_1?s=pc&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1411610906&amp;amp;sr=1-1&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;USB wireless dongle&lt;/a&gt; and added it to a USB port on the Pi. The dongle is very easy to install and connect to WiFi using the Raspbian Desktop environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once it was online, I found out the hostname for the Pi using this command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;hostname -I
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This should give you an address that looks something like &lt;code&gt;192.168.1.199&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, using a Mac/Linux terminal or Putty on Windows, you can create an ssh connection directly to the Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;ssh pi@192.168.1.199
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you set up a different username, you can replace &amp;lsquo;pi&amp;rsquo; with that username. Now, you should be able to access your Pi remotely and copy files over using an FTP client like FileZilla or a bash command like &lt;code&gt;scp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, I have gradually developed an avid interest in automobiles. Before that, my fascination with cars only extended to the aesthetics. However, after regularly racing go karts this summer and getting hooked on watching Formula 1, I have also come to appreciate the performance of vehicles. In order to understand these beautiful beasts, I am writing a series on the basics of an automobile in order to get an introductory understanding of the involved mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jimmy-learns-stick&#34;&gt;Jimmy learns stick&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, my friend Jimmy wanted to learn how to drive a manual car. I learned to drive stick since an early age, and I was confident that I could teach him how, or so I thought. I explained the theory of manual driving to Jimmy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change gears while pressing the clutch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As you let go of the clutch gradually, press the gas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not possessing a manual car myself, we recruited another friend, Nick, to help teach Jimmy the ways of the manual gods. Not only did Nick help us with the car, but he also blew me away with his knowledge and instruction of how a manual car works. Unlike my ignorant teaching style, he delved into topics of torque, RPMs, gears and differentials. Humbled, I listened patiently and decided to do more research on how a car’s transmission works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-gears-work&#34;&gt;How gears work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to understand a car’s transmission, we need to know the basics behind gears. Gears are useful in transferring power by creating a mechanical advantage. This has a lot to do with rotational speed and torques. Let’s say we have two gears, Gear 1 and Gear 2, and their teeth are interlocked together. Gear 2 is twice as big as Gear 1. If we start rotating 1 at 10 RPMs, 2 will rotate at 5 RPMs. This is simply because Gear 2 is twice as big and it takes longer for it to go through one rotation at that particular rotational speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Gear 2 is rotating at 5 RPMs, the torque applied on Gear 2 is higher, because the same amount of power is transferred from Gear 1 to Gear 2. Essentially, this means that the size difference between the two gears allows Gear 1 to exert more force on Gear 2 without having to work that much harder. Look here for a deeper explanation for the relationship between power and torque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what leads us into car transmissions. When a car is stopped, the wheels are reluctant to move due to friction and Newton’s first law of motion. In order to get a car moving without damaging the engine, gears are used. Imagine that the rotating parts of the engine are Gear 1 and the wheels are connected to Gear 2. This allows the engine to transfer more force to the wheels and get them started. Now, once the car is in motion, we can switch to higher gears that can then harness the complete rotational speed of the drive shaft to go faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-gearbox&#34;&gt;The gearbox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

				alt=&#34;Gearbox&#34;&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
		
		&lt;figcaption&gt;Gearbox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
		
	&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know the magic behind gears, let’s see how we actually go about changing them in the car. Let’s see what is happening in the picture above. The drive shaft is connected to the engine and is colored green. The gears themselves are labeled and colored blue. The yellow shaft is connected to the wheels. The red assembly is the layshaft which helps to change gears without having to move too many pieces around inside a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that blue gears decrease in size and the red gears increase in size from left to right. This is to ensure the correct transfer of torque to the wheels. In 1st gear, we want more torque to get the car moving, hence the big blue gear and the small red gear. In 5th gear, we want to transfer all the RPMs from the engine to the wheels, hence the gears are both the same size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this setup, the blue gears are currently free, which means that if they rotate, the yellow shaft will not rotate with them. In order to make the yellow shaft rotate, the pink cogs are used to lock the blue gears on to the shaft. When you change gears in a car, you move the stick which in turn moves the corresponding pink cog and locks the appropriate blue gear in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing missing from this picture is the clutch. The clutch is used to make sure that the engine is not damaged when changing gears. It utilized friction to ensure a smoother operation between the gearbox and the engine when changing gears. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqF-aBtTBnY&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;This video&lt;/a&gt; does a great job of explaining how the clutch works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you didn’t think I did a good job in explaining how the transmission in a car works, you can check out &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K53cPGRE1Kk&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; that does a great job and also uses some cool animations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Skydiving</title>
        <link>http://ishmeetgrewal.com/p/skydiving/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2014 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://ishmeetgrewal.com/p/skydiving/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://ishmeetgrewal.com/p/skydiving/skydiving.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Skydiving" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to cross off another thing off my &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://ishmeetgrewal.com/impossible&#34; &gt;Impossible List&lt;/a&gt;, I went skydiving today. I’m not too big on large men strapped to my back with our pelvic regions in close proximity, so I chose to go the Accelerated Free Fall (AFF) route. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.startskydiving.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Start Skydiving&lt;/a&gt; in Middletown, OH, the number 1 dropzone in the world, offers the First Jump Course for people who want to learn the basics of skydiving and may want to pursue a license in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrrived in Middletown around 8 in the morning and went through the course which walked us through all the details of skydiving. My instructor was a former Army Ranger with about 1000 jumps under his belt, and he walked us through the flight, the fall, the canopy deployment, landing, everything. He didn’t make it a chore either, keeping us all interested and enthused with his sense of humor and anecdotes that never disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After six hours of practicing the body movements, learning the components of a parachute, and relentlessly chanting the Emergency Procedures, we were ready to jump. However, the winds kept blowing above the recommended limit, and delayed for a long time. We saw loads of people who had licenses jump one, two, three, even four times. However, it wasn’t our time yet. I passed the day drinking lots of water, watching other people land from the sky, and generally being nervous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winds finally died down around 8pm and we were clear to jump. Another instructor outfitted me with my gear and triple checked everything. We planned our flight and landing pattern, and were ready to go. During our training, when we were practicing the Emergency procedures, our instructor had said something that stuck with me. Commenting on the malfunction where both the main and the reserve canopy open and get tangled, he said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You literally have the rest of your life to figure this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, that popped into my head as I followed my instructor to the plane. We began the slow climb to 13,500 feet in the small prop plane. On the way up, my instructor kept asking me questions and had me replay the whole dive flow and landing pattern in my head multiple times. Then the green light went on inside the cabin, and someone slid open the door. There, three feet in front of me was the gaping hole that led out into the abyss. In AFF, two instructors jump with you, one on each side. As soon as one of my instructors went to stand on a small ledge OUTSIDE the plane while holding on to, I positioned myself in the doorway. My other instructor had a grip on me from inside and urged me to stand up in the door. The air rushed my face and body at 120mph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked in with both my instructors and off we went towards the ground. I was expecting my stomach to drop, but since our forward momentum just gradually transferred to downward momentum, I felt nothing. I don’t remember thinking of anything at all. I felt no fear, I was not nervous, and I didn’t particularly look down. I couldn’t hear or smell anything in particular. I focused on my altimeter and completing my practice touches to the deployment handle. Once at 6000 feet, I pulled the chute and watched in awe as both my instructors dropped away from me at 120mph (They deployed their chutes at 3000 feet!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I determined that my canopy was there, square, and steerable, I settled down to enjoy the view. One of the perks of waiting so long was that we had jumped on the last flight of the day. So, as I turned my chute around 360 degrees, there in front of me in all it’s glory was an absolutely beautiful sunset from 5000 feet. I was enchanted a little too much, because the winds ended up carrying me off course and I had to fly a corrective pattern back to the landing zone. I played around with my canopy, twirling this way and that, until it was time to start the landing procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my instructor guiding me over a radio, I flared to a landing about 4 feet too high, and dropped to the ground for the last bit. A truck came around and picked us up. After debriefing with my instructor, I received my First Jump Course Certificate and was encouraged to come back and pursue my license, which I definitely intend on doing this summer. I’m going to be living 15 minutes away from the place, might as well use that to my advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I love to travel. Have you figured that out yet? My passion for travelling takes me to new cities, countries, and continents. I usually fly to places, but I didn’t know how a jet engine works to take me to new destinations. Since I will be working at GE Aviation this summer, I decided to figure out how a jet engine works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.geaviation.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;GE Aviation&lt;/a&gt;, the builder of the best jet engines in the world, did an excellent job in creating this &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.geaviation.com/education/engines101/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;interactive explanation&lt;/a&gt; of how jet engines function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-science-principles-behind-jet-engines&#34;&gt;The science principles behind jet engines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Newton&amp;rsquo;s Law&lt;/strong&gt; - Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. When thrust is generated by the engine, the force of the thrust pushing back propels the airplane forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bernoulli&amp;rsquo;s Principle&lt;/strong&gt; - Air that moves faster exerts lower pressure. The curved nature of wings and propellers allows air to move faster over one surface, creating lift and pushing the plane up and forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyle&amp;rsquo;s Law&lt;/strong&gt; - Volume, Pressure, and Temperature of a gas have a unique relationship. If the volume is decreased, the pressure increases, and vice versa. If the temperature is increased, pressure also increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-engine&#34;&gt;The engine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
		
		&lt;figcaption&gt;Jet Engine&lt;/figcaption&gt;
		
	&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The propeller in the front gathers the air and feeds it into the compressor. The compressor utilized Boyle’s law and compresses the air to increase its pressure. The air then enters the combustion chamber and where gas is injected and ignited to heat the gas and increase the pressure. The air is then pushed out from the exhaust to produce the thrust to propel the airplane. On its way out, the air turns a turbine which in turn powers the front propeller to gather more air and keep the process going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a simple concept, and yet it enables millions of people to get from one end of the world to another and fuel their traveling passions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hello World</title>
        <link>http://ishmeetgrewal.com/p/hello-world/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2014 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://ishmeetgrewal.com/p/hello-world/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I had a startling revelation – I don’t actually know how most of the world works. Of course, I understand math concepts and I know that human beings need oxygen to live. But what about WiFi? 4G LTE? The contact lenses I rely on everyday? From complicated systems like the New York City Subway to trivial things like scotch tape, I have absolutely no clue how numerous things function and enable me to live my comfortable lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also realized that instead of trying to figure all these things out, I was simply content with the knowledge that with my smart phone in my pocket, which is probably smarter than me, and with the power of Google, I would have all this knowledge at my fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I found myself looking up things I had already researched before, which means that this instant access to knowledge was not contributing to any significant understanding on my part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we go then. Starting on April 16, 2014, I will write one daily post about something new I learned. This will help me to keep track of my progress in my quest for knowledge and hopefully make me a better writer along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will try to make every post as simple as possible while attempting to explain all the details about something that I did not previously know, but have now researched thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is probably written very terribly, but that’s OK. I will get better. If you stick it out with me, hopefully you will also learn something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You know nothing, Jon Snow.&amp;rdquo; - &lt;cite&gt;Ygritte, Game of Thrones&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, I’m in the same boat as poor Jon. But no matter, I will soon know more than I do today, for now my watch begins.&lt;/p&gt;
