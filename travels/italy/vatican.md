The Italian Railways brought us back to the Eternal City where we had started out 13 glorious days ago. This time around, we were pretty familiar with Rome and after dropping off our bags and a quick lunch, we headed to the Vatican. This time around, in lieu of our short timetable, we picked a skip the line tour and were guided through the Vatican museusm and the Sistine chapel.

All the artwork was spectacular and mad props to Michelangelo for that amazing ceiling. But it was St. Peter’s Basilica that blew me away. The immense size of the church dwarfed everything around it and when I entered, I felt entirely alone despite the throngs of people milling around me. After two weeks of running around, it felt good to just quietly appreciate the magnificent
architecture and the effect it had on me.

There were sun rays coming down from a window in the dome and I almost expected to rise into Heaven as I walked into them. The whole place was absolutely magical. I can see your smile as you read this, thinking I’m being sarcastic. But I’m telling you, standing in there feeling quite at peace, I think it was a great way to end an excellent trip.
