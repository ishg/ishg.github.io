<p>From heating up the leftover meals to making popcorn, every time I open a microwave door, a little voice in the back of my head reminds me not to use any metal containers. Although I follow the advice every time, I never questioned the meaning behind it.</p>

<p>From heating up the leftover meals to making popcorn, every time I open a microwave door, a little voice in the back of my head reminds me not to use any metal containers. Although I follow the advice every time, I never questioned the meaning behind it.</p>

<p>Microwaves can pass through plastic, glass, or Styrofoam container to reach the food. However, molecules in metals are so densely packed that they prevent the microwaves from getting through. Thus, the waves just end up bouncing around the area and not cooking the food properly. They may even end up harming the appliance because of the endless bouncing.</p>

<p>This doesn’t explain the sparks we sometimes see when metal objects are placed in the microwave oven. It turns out that those sparks are simply caused by an electric field generated by the microwave oscillation. This electric field concentrates around any sharp objects or corners, similar to how a lightning rod protects our home from lightning. Sparks are visible when the electricity in the field discharges.</p>

<p>So, it’s that simple. I love science. Now the little voice in my head will also remind me of the reason behind not putting metals in the microwave oven. This concept was so simply and wonderfully explained by <a href="https://engineering.mit.edu/ask/why-can%E2%80%99t-we-put-metal-objects-microwave">MIT School of Engineering</a></p>

        Hello World
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>A few months ago, I had a startling revelation – I don’t actually know how most of the world works. Of course, I understand math concepts and I know that human beings need oxygen to live. But what about WiFi? 4G LTE? The contact lenses I rely on everyday? From complicated systems like the New York City Subway to trivial things like scotch tape, I have absolutely no clue how numerous things function and enable me to live my comfortable lifestyle.</p>

<p>I also realized that instead of trying to figure all these things out, I was simply content with the knowledge that with my smart phone in my pocket, which is probably smarter than me, and with the power of Google, I would have all this knowledge at my fingertips.</p>

<p>However, I found myself looking up things I had already researched before, which means that this instant access to knowledge was not contributing to any significant understanding on my part.</p>

<p>Here we go then. Starting on April 16, 2014, I will write one daily post about something new I learned. This will help me to keep track of my progress in my quest for knowledge and hopefully make me a better writer along the way.</p>

<p>I will try to make every post as simple as possible while attempting to explain all the details about something that I did not previously know, but have now researched thoroughly.</p>

<p>This post is probably written very terribly, but that’s OK. I will get better. If you stick it out with me, hopefully you will also learn something new.</p>

<p>Alas, I’m in the same boat as poor Jon. But no matter, I will soon know more than I do today, for now my watch begins.</p>
