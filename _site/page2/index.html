        Engine Brakes
      </a>

    <p>Often while driving, I have noticed a road sign labeled “No Engine Brake.” These signs can usually be found in residential neighborhoods, and most likely right before a steep decline in the road. Today I learned what engine brakes are used for.</p>

<p>Since most transportation trucks weigh a lot, slowing them down from high speeds takes a lot of force. Relying on brake pads alone to do this job deteriorates the brakes along with the wheels while also raising a possibility of a potential failure. Therefore, truck manufacturers install <strong>engine brakes</strong> in truck engines which essentially convert a power-producing engine into a power absorbing air compressor.</p>

<p>A diesel engine in a truck does not have a spark plug. Instead, it compresses air and uses the heat of the compressed air to ignite the directly injected fuel. An engine brake simply opens a valve at the top of the piston movement which releases the compressed air and does not push the piston back down preventing the crankshaft from turning. This slows the engine down considerably and saves the strain on the brake pads.</p>

<p>The release of air into the exhaust system produces a lot of noise, especially if the system is not muffled properly. This noise can be a huge nuisance to people in residential neighborhoods, hence, the signs prohibiting the use of engine brakes. Engine brakes are also called jake brakes, named after the biggest manufacturer <a href="http://www.jacobsvehiclesystems.com/technology/compression-release-brakes/">Jacobs Vehicle Systems</a></p>

        Airplanes and Contrails

<p>When driving back home for the three-day weekend, I noticed a beautiful sunset in my rear-view mirror. The dazzling display of colors was also accompanied by crisscrossing white lines left behind by airplanes. I had always wondered what those elongated clouds in the sky were, so I decided to research more when I arrived home.</p>

<p>Sometimes on a cold winter day, we can see our breath in the air or see the exhaust from a car spiraling up towards the sky. The trails left behind by airplanes are very similar to those phenomenon. The white cloud lines are called “condensation trails”, or <strong>contrails</strong> for short. A jet engine emits a lot of hot water vapor into the atmosphere, which, upon contact with the extremely cold air at such a high altitude, immediately turns to ice crystals. These crystals essentially form a cirrus cloud, which expands and spreads out until it disappears.</p>

<p>But sometimes I see a plane in the air and no contrails accompanying it. Why is that? Simply put, the air is too dry and the water vapor dissipates into it almost immediately. The contrails last much longer in moist air because it takes time for them to be absorbed into the already saturated air molecules. Nevertheless, contrails are definitely a nice addition to a beautiful sunset in my opinion.</p>
