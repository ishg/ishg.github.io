    <p>Every day I wake up and use the mirror to get ready for work or school. I can’t tie my turban without a mirror. I can’t put my contact lenses in without a mirror. Still, I have no idea how this simple yet essential tool works.</p>

<p>In high school science classes, I learned about the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection. The <strong>Law of Reflection</strong> stated that for light, the angle of incidence (the angle at which light enters a surface) is the same as the angle of  reflection (the angle at which light leaves a surface). However, this would propose that light stopped when it hit the mirror, changed directions, then accelerated back to light speed. This would violate laws of physics as photons are not allowed to stop or slow down.</p>

<p>The physics behind this reflection is a little tricky, but really it can be boiled down to a game of hot-potato. Mirrors are just panes of glass coated with metal, usually silver. This metal coating has an outer layer of electrons that just wander around looking for things to do. When light encounters the mirror coating, these electrons snatch away the photons and absorb them in the molecule. But this is too much energy for the molecule to handle, so it releases this energy by emitting more photons away, creating the “reflection” of light.</p>

<p>Why can only mirrors reflect light properly then? It all has to do with molecular structures and the physics of light. When the surface is smooth and has free electrons that need something to do, it acts like a mirror. When the surface is rough and the electrons are busy doing something else, it just diffuses the light rays. Consider this, water in a pool or a glass acts as mirror, but when it turns into ice or snow, the texture change causes the reflection properties of water to disappear. Water is a magical thing, and so is science.</p>

        Engine Brakes

    <p>Often while driving, I have noticed a road sign labeled “No Engine Brake.” These signs can usually be found in residential neighborhoods, and most likely right before a steep decline in the road. Today I learned what engine brakes are used for.</p>

<p>Since most transportation trucks weigh a lot, slowing them down from high speeds takes a lot of force. Relying on brake pads alone to do this job deteriorates the brakes along with the wheels while also raising a possibility of a potential failure. Therefore, truck manufacturers install <strong>engine brakes</strong> in truck engines which essentially convert a power-producing engine into a power absorbing air compressor.</p>

<p>A diesel engine in a truck does not have a spark plug. Instead, it compresses air and uses the heat of the compressed air to ignite the directly injected fuel. An engine brake simply opens a valve at the top of the piston movement which releases the compressed air and does not push the piston back down preventing the crankshaft from turning. This slows the engine down considerably and saves the strain on the brake pads.</p>

<p>The release of air into the exhaust system produces a lot of noise, especially if the system is not muffled properly. This noise can be a huge nuisance to people in residential neighborhoods, hence, the signs prohibiting the use of engine brakes. Engine brakes are also called jake brakes, named after the biggest manufacturer <a href="http://www.jacobsvehiclesystems.com/technology/compression-release-brakes/">Jacobs Vehicle Systems</a></p>

    <p><img src="/assets/contrails.jpg" alt="Contrails" title="Contrails"></p>

<p>When driving back home for the three-day weekend, I noticed a beautiful sunset in my rear-view mirror. The dazzling display of colors was also accompanied by crisscrossing white lines left behind by airplanes. I had always wondered what those elongated clouds in the sky were, so I decided to research more when I arrived home.</p>

<p>Sometimes on a cold winter day, we can see our breath in the air or see the exhaust from a car spiraling up towards the sky. The trails left behind by airplanes are very similar to those phenomenon. The white cloud lines are called “condensation trails”, or <strong>contrails</strong> for short. A jet engine emits a lot of hot water vapor into the atmosphere, which, upon contact with the extremely cold air at such a high altitude, immediately turns to ice crystals. These crystals essentially form a cirrus cloud, which expands and spreads out until it disappears.</p>

<p>But sometimes I see a plane in the air and no contrails accompanying it. Why is that? Simply put, the air is too dry and the water vapor dissipates into it almost immediately. The contrails last much longer in moist air because it takes time for them to be absorbed into the already saturated air molecules. Nevertheless, contrails are definitely a nice addition to a beautiful sunset in my opinion.</p>

<p>From heating up the leftover meals to making popcorn, every time I open a microwave door, a little voice in the back of my head reminds me not to use any metal containers. Although I follow the advice every time, I never questioned the meaning behind it.</p>

<p>From heating up the leftover meals to making popcorn, every time I open a microwave door, a little voice in the back of my head reminds me not to use any metal containers. Although I follow the advice every time, I never questioned the meaning behind it.</p>

<p>Microwaves can pass through plastic, glass, or Styrofoam container to reach the food. However, molecules in metals are so densely packed that they prevent the microwaves from getting through. Thus, the waves just end up bouncing around the area and not cooking the food properly. They may even end up harming the appliance because of the endless bouncing.</p>

<p>This doesn’t explain the sparks we sometimes see when metal objects are placed in the microwave oven. It turns out that those sparks are simply caused by an electric field generated by the microwave oscillation. This electric field concentrates around any sharp objects or corners, similar to how a lightning rod protects our home from lightning. Sparks are visible when the electricity in the field discharges.</p>

<p>So, it’s that simple. I love science. Now the little voice in my head will also remind me of the reason behind not putting metals in the microwave oven. This concept was so simply and wonderfully explained by <a href="https://engineering.mit.edu/ask/why-can%E2%80%99t-we-put-metal-objects-microwave">MIT School of Engineering</a></p>

    <p>A few months ago, I had a startling revelation – I don’t actually know how most of the world works. Of course, I understand math concepts and I know that human beings need oxygen to live. But what about WiFi? 4G LTE? The contact lenses I rely on everyday? From complicated systems like the New York City Subway to trivial things like scotch tape, I have absolutely no clue how numerous things function and enable me to live my comfortable lifestyle.</p>

<p>I also realized that instead of trying to figure all these things out, I was simply content with the knowledge that with my smart phone in my pocket, which is probably smarter than me, and with the power of Google, I would have all this knowledge at my fingertips.</p>

<p>However, I found myself looking up things I had already researched before, which means that this instant access to knowledge was not contributing to any significant understanding on my part.</p>

<p>Here we go then. Starting on April 16, 2014, I will write one daily post about something new I learned. This will help me to keep track of my progress in my quest for knowledge and hopefully make me a better writer along the way.</p>

<p>I will try to make every post as simple as possible while attempting to explain all the details about something that I did not previously know, but have now researched thoroughly.</p>

<p>This post is probably written very terribly, but that’s OK. I will get better. If you stick it out with me, hopefully you will also learn something new.</p>

<p>Alas, I’m in the same boat as poor Jon. But no matter, I will soon know more than I do today, for now my watch begins.</p>
