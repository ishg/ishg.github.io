  <h1 class="post-title">Hello World</h1>
  <span class="post-date">14 Apr 2014</span>
  <p>A few months ago, I had a startling revelation – I don’t actually know how most of the world works. Of course, I understand math concepts and I know that human beings need oxygen to live. But what about WiFi? 4G LTE? The contact lenses I rely on everyday? From complicated systems like the New York City Subway to trivial things like scotch tape, I have absolutely no clue how numerous things function and enable me to live my comfortable lifestyle.</p>

<p>I also realized that instead of trying to figure all these things out, I was simply content with the knowledge that with my smart phone in my pocket, which is probably smarter than me, and with the power of Google, I would have all this knowledge at my fingertips.</p>

<p>However, I found myself looking up things I had already researched before, which means that this instant access to knowledge was not contributing to any significant understanding on my part.</p>

<p>Here we go then. Starting on April 16, 2014, I will write one daily post about something new I learned. This will help me to keep track of my progress in my quest for knowledge and hopefully make me a better writer along the way.</p>

<p>I will try to make every post as simple as possible while attempting to explain all the details about something that I did not previously know, but have now researched thoroughly.</p>

<p>This post is probably written very terribly, but that’s OK. I will get better. If you stick it out with me, hopefully you will also learn something new.</p>

<p>&quot;You know nothing, Jon Snow.&quot; - <cite>Ygritte, Game of Thrones</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alas, I’m in the same boat as poor Jon. But no matter, I will soon know more than I do today, for now my watch begins.</p>
